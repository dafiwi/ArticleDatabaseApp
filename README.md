Article Database GUI App to create, read, update and delete data records in a SQLite file

This program was written with C#/.NET 6.0 as a WPF application to access a SQLite database file.

The app is for demonstration purposes only. The source files are also included in a specific directory.

Click Read to read from the included database file which you can modify as you wish. Click on a data record in the list view above to update or delete it.
Use the text boxes to create a new data record. You have to check the Edit check box before you can change the database entries.

If this program doesn't start on your computer, you have to allow to start it first for security reasons, if there is an option to do so.
